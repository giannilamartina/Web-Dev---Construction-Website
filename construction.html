        Moderna has embarked on a mission to change the world through affordable, long-lasting structures.
        Started in 1963 by Hermsfeld Vagerbond, Moderna has lived through the heydey of traditional stick-building
        and was an early pioneer of modular construction. Hermsfeld was a master engineer, well-known in his home
        country of Dirklefitz for designing and constructing magnificent buildings, utilizing old storage containers
        and prebuilt structures to revitalize his downtrodden community. Hermseld's charitable mindset still thrives
        within Moderna to this day. Our motto is "Do nothing without intention. Do everything with good intention".
